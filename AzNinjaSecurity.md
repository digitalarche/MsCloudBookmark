#All the Microsoft Ninja Training I Know About#

There’s been a big rush of new interest in Microsoft security certifications recently. 
There’s some fantastic Learn modules (the SC series) created to help those seeking certifications, 
but these are great sources of knowledge training by themselves.

But, a lot of you have shown interest in the “Ninja” training that’s been put together by our product teams.
There’s been so much interest, I decided to go down that route and complete them all myself to figure out what you’ve all been raving about.

Someone asked recently about where all of these are located and I realized the links might be valuable to others, so here they are…

Did I miss any? Let me know.

**EXTRA:** 
Do you know why the trainings are labeled “Ninja” trainings instead of something like “Samurai” trainings? 
I mean, in feudal Japan, the Ninja was a miscreant, while the Samurai was an honorable warrior.
