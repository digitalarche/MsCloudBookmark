## Practice Environments

[Write your first query with Kusto Query Language (Learn module)](https://cda.ms/3hR)

[KQL Playground](https://cda.ms/3bZ) – only need a valid Microsoft account to access.

[Data Explorer](https://cda.ms/3c0) – not security focused. Contains things like geographical data and weather patterns. Exercises for this can be found in the *Learn Azure Sentinel* book below.



## Actual Books

[Learn Azure Sentinel: Integrate Azure security with artificial intelligence to build secure cloud systems](https://cda.ms/3c7) – this book uses Data Explorer (see above) for hands-on exercises.

[Azure Sentinel in Action: Architect, design, implement, and operate Azure Sentinel as the core of your security solutions](https://cda.ms/3c8) – this book is the next edition of the one just above and also used Data Explorer for hands-on examples.



## Tools

[Kusto.Explorer](https://cda.ms/3c1) – a rich desktop application that enables you to explore your data using the Kusto Query Language in an easy-to-use user interface.

[Kusto CLI](https://cda.ms/3c3) – a command-line utility that is used to send requests to Kusto, and display the results.

[Visual Studio Code](https://cda.ms/3c5) with the [Kusto extensions pack](https://cda.ms/3c6)

[Real-Time KQL](https://cda.ms/3cz) – eliminates the need to ingest data first before querying by processing event streams with KQL queries as events arrive, in real-time

[getschema operator](https://cda.ms/3jy) – As I noted in [Part 5](https://cda.ms/3jx) of this series: this is *the Rosetta stone of KQL operators*. When used, getschema displays the Column Name, Column Ordinal, Data Type, and Column Type for a table. This is important information for filtering data. [Part 5 talks about this](https://cda.ms/3jz).
